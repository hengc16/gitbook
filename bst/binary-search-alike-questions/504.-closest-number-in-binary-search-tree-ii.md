# 504. Closest Number In Binary Search Tree II

In a binary search tree, find k nodes containing the closest numbers to the given target number. return them in sorted array

**Assumptions:**

* The given root is not null.
* There are no duplicate keys in the binary search tree.

**Examples:**

    ****5

  /    \

2      11

     /    \

    6     14

closest number to 4 is 5

closest number to 10 is 11

closest number to 6 is 6

**How is the binary tree represented?**

We use the level order traversal sequence with a special symbol "\#" denoting the null node.

**For Example:**

The sequence \[1, 2, 3, \#, \#, 4\] represents the following binary tree:

    1

  /   \

 2     3

      /

    4
